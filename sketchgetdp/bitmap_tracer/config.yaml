# Bitmap Tracer Configuration
#
# This configuration file controls the behavior of the bitmap tracing process.
# All parameters have sensible defaults and can be adjusted based on the
# characteristics of the input images and desired output quality.

## Structure Limits
# Maximum number of structures to keep for each color category after filtering.
# Structures are sorted by area (largest first) and only the top N are kept.
red_dots: 10    # Maximum red points to preserve
blue_paths: 5   # Maximum blue paths to preserve  
green_paths: 5  # Maximum green paths to preserve

## Contour Detection Parameters
# Control how contours are detected and filtered from the source image.
min_area: 150           # Minimum area in pixels for a valid contour
max_area_ratio: 0.8     # Maximum contour area as ratio of total image area (0.0-1.0)
point_max_area: 100     # Maximum area for a contour to be classified as a point
point_max_perimeter: 80 # Maximum perimeter for point classification
closure_tolerance: 5.0  # Maximum gap distance for automatic contour closure (pixels)
circularity_threshold: 0.01  # Minimum circularity (4πA/P²) for valid contours

## Curve Fitting Parameters  
# Control the conversion of pixel contours to smooth SVG paths.
angle_threshold: 25     # Angle in degrees below which segments are treated as straight lines
min_curve_angle: 120    # Minimum angle for considering a segment as a curve
epsilon_factor: 0.0015  # Simplification factor for Douglas-Peucker algorithm
closure_threshold: 10.0 # Maximum gap distance for considering a path closed (pixels)

## Color Detection Parameters
# Define thresholds for categorizing colors in the source image.
blue_hue_range: [100, 140]         # HSV hue range for blue color detection
red_hue_range: [[0, 10], [170, 180]] # HSV hue ranges for red color detection
green_hue_range: [35, 85]          # HSV hue range for green color detection
color_difference_threshold: 20     # Minimum RGB channel difference for color dominance
min_saturation: 50                 # Minimum saturation to avoid classifying as white
max_value_white: 200               # Maximum value above which colors are considered white
min_value_black: 50                # Minimum value below which colors are considered black

## SVG Generation Parameters
# Control the visual appearance of the generated SVG output.
point_radius: 4        # Radius of point markers in pixels
stroke_width: 2        # Width of path strokes in pixels
blue_color: "#0000FF"  # Hex color code for blue paths
red_color: "#FF0000"   # Hex color code for red points  
green_color: "#00FF00" # Hex color code for green paths
