# Bitmap Tracer Configuration
#
# This configuration file controls the behavior of the bitmap tracing process.
# All parameters have sensible defaults and can be adjusted based on the
# characteristics of the input images and desired output quality.

## Structure Limits
# Maximum number of structures to keep for each color category after filtering.
# Structures are sorted by area (largest first) and only the top N are kept.
red_dots: 1    # Maximum red points to preserve
blue_paths: 1   # Maximum blue paths to preserve  
green_paths: 1  # Maximum green paths to preserve

## Contour Detection Parameters
# Control how contours are detected and filtered from the source image.
point_max_area: 2000     # Maximum area for a contour to be classified as a point
point_max_perimeter: 1000 # Maximum perimeter for point classification

## Color Detection Parameters
# Define thresholds for categorizing colors in the source image.
blue_hue_range: [100, 140]         # HSV hue range for blue color detection
red_hue_range: [[0, 10], [170, 180]] # HSV hue ranges for red color detection
green_hue_range: [35, 85]          # HSV hue range for green color detection
min_saturation: 50                 # Minimum saturation to avoid classifying as white
max_value_white: 200               # Maximum value above which colors are considered white
min_value_black: 50                # Minimum value below which colors are considered black
